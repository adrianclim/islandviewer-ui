<p class="smalltext"><span class="subHeader">Genomic Islands</span> - large genomic regions (typically &gt; 8kb), that are thought to have horizontal origins. These regions can often contain genes that are related to antibiotic resistance or virulence.</p>

<p class="smalltext"><span class="subHeader">Sequence Composition GI Prediction Methods</span> - bacterial genomes tend to naturally have differences in sequence composition such as GC% and codon bias. Therefore, a region within a genome that has abnormal sequence composition could indicate that it originated from another genome. Various tools (incl. SIGI-HMM and IslandPath-DIMOB) look for regions with abnormal sequence composition.  </p>
		  
<p class="smalltext"><span class="subHeader">Comparative Genomic GI Prediction Methods</span> - genomic regions that are not present within related strains suggest that the region was horizontally transferred. IslandPick is a method that automatically selects comparison genomes that are within a proper evolutionary distance and identifies regions that are unique to only a single genome. </p>

<p class="subHeader">IslandPick<a name="islandpick" id="islandpick"></a></p>

<p class="bodyText">In a recent study (<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/329" target="_blank">Langille et al., 2008</a>), we describe a new method called <a href="{% url 'islandpick' %}">IslandPick</a> that uses a<em> comparative genomic GI prediction method </em>  to develop  stringent data sets of GIs and non-GIs. These positive and negative data sets were used to evaluate several <em>sequence composition GI prediction methods</em> and showed that SIGI-HMM and IslandPath-DIMOB were shown to have the highest overall accuracy. In addition, IslandPick had the most agreement with an independent data set of previously published genomes indicating that it was a highly precise method for GI prediction. IslandPick requires  several phylogentically related genomes to be sequenced to be able to make a prediction; therefore, predictions will not be available for many genomes. Non-default comparison genomes may be chosen using the <a href="{% url 'islandpick' %}">IslandPick link</a>. For more information please see <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/329" target="_blank">Langille et al., 2008</a> and/or our <a href="datasets/Islandpick_GI_dataset_overview.pdf" target="_blank">overview presentation</a>. </p>

<p class="subHeader">SIGI-HMM<a name="sigi" id="sigi"></a></p>

<p class="bodyText"><a href="http://www.tcs.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/colombo-sigihmm" target="_blank">SIGI-HMM</a> (see <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/142" target="_blank">Waack et al., 2006</a>) is a <em>sequence composition GI prediction method</em> that is part of the Columbo package. This method uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and measures codon usage to identify possible GIs. In a recent study, SIGI-HMM was shown to have the highest precision and overall accuracy, out of six tested <em>sequence composition GI prediction methods</em> (<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/329" target="_blank">Langille et al., 2008</a>). </p>

<p class="subHeader">IslandPath-DIMOB<a name="dimob" id="dimob"></a></p>
		  
<p class="bodyText"><a href="http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandpath/" target="_blank">IslandPath</a> (see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/418" target="_blank">Hsiao et al., 2003</a>) was originally designed to aid to the identification of prokaryotic genomics islands (GIs), by visualizing several common characteristics of GIs such as abnormal sequence composition or the presence of genes that functionally related to mobile elements (termed <em>mobility genes</em>). </p>
		  		  
<p class="bodyText">Our subsequent studies (see <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/329" target="_blank">Langille et al., 2008</a>), showed that dinucleotide sequence composition bias   and the presence of <em>mobility genes </em>were    good indicators for identifying GIs. In fact, it was tied with SIGI-HMM for having the highest overall accuracy and traded a slightly lower precision for higher recall. </p>

<p class="subHeader">Virulence Factors and Antibiotic Resistance Genes<a name="vir" id="vir"></a></p>
		  
<p class="bodyText">Virulence factor classifications are incorporated from the 2012 release of the <a href="http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/" target="_blank">Virulence Factor Database, VFDB</a>, (see <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/D1/D641.full" target="_blank">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Antibiotic resistance gene classifications were downloaded from the <a href="http://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Antibiotic Resistance Gene Database, ARDB</a> (see <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/suppl_1/D443.long" target="_blank">Liu et al., 2009</a>). These gene classifications are now available for visualization on top of GI predictions on a separate track. Genes within GIs that are classified as virulence factors or antibiotic resistance genes are indicated in the gene descriptions with links to the respective entries in VFDB or ARDB for more information. This first release is very conservative and just notes those genes that are actually annotated in VFDB and ARDB, but we may add information regarding close homologs of these genes in related species in the near future.</p>
		  
<p class="subHeader">Pathogen-Associated Genes<a name="pag" id="pag"></a></p>

<p class="bodyText">Pathogen-associated genes are those genes only found in pathogens and not in non-pathogens according to set criteria. A study conducted by Ho Sui et al. in 2009 compiled a list of these pathogen-associated genes (see <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008094" target="_blank">Ho Sui et al., 2009</a>) and these annotations are also available for visualization on top of GI predictions. All data that were used are available for download <a href="http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/pathogen-associated/" target="_blank">here</a>. For robustness we included only those pathogen-associated genes found conserved across at least three genera (but never in non-pathogens of any genera). This analysis is currently being updated further and refined for a future release.</p>
		  
<p class="bodyText"><span class="subHeader">Analysis Considerations<a name="considerations" id="considerations"></a> </span></p>

<p class="bodyText"><a href="{% url 'browse' %}">IslandViewer</a> integrates two <em>sequence composition GI prediction methods</em> SIGI-HMM and IslandPath-DIMOB, and a single <em>comparative GI prediction method</em> IslandPick. These methods have varying advantages and disadvantages. </p>
		  
<p class="bodyText"><em>Sequence composition GI prediction methods</em> may have difficulty detecting ancient GIs due to the amelioration of the foreign DNA to the host genome over time. Also, these methods will have difficulty detecting GIs that have originated from a genome with  similar sequence composition as the host genome. Lastly, these methods can make false predictions due to the normal variation in sequence composition that can occur in bacterial genomes.</p>

<p class="bodyText"><em>Comparative GI prediction methods  </em>depend heavily on the genomes that are chosen for comparison. For instance, the selection of very similar genomes will result in the prediction of only recently inserted GIs, while comparing with more distantly related genomes will detect many more GIs (including recent and ancient GIs), but may increase the chance of false prediction. <a href="{% url 'islandpick' %}">IslandPick</a> uses several different cutoffs to automatically select genomes for comparison, but users have the choice to select different comparison genomes based on their own insights.</p>

<p class="bodyText">In general, we recommend that users take advantage of the ability to view GI predictions from all three methods in a single integrated view. To aid this further, we have highlighted islands that are predicted by one or more tools as <span class="red">red</span> around the outer circle. </p>

<p class="subHeader">Conducting Further Analysis<a name="analysis" id="analysis"></a> </p>

<p class="bodyText">We strongly encourage researchers to conduct further analyses of any GIs displayed by IslandViewer. As outlined above, in <a href="{% url 'about' %}#considerations">Analysis Considerations</a>, there are many factors that can lead to false prediction   by any GI prediction program. In addition, any GIs that are very close to each other in the genome may actually be one large GI insertion (or vice versa) and the exact boundaries or insertion sites should be inspected in more detail. We recommend the use of the following computational tools to aid in further analysis of genomic islands.</p>

<p class="bodyText"><a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Artemis/">Artemis</a>, is a popular and well developed genome browser and annotation tool. IslandViewer allows users to download predicted GIs in a GenBank file format that can be opened directly in Artemis. The GIs will appear in Artemis  using  the same colour scheme used in IslandViewer (i.e. green for IslandPick, orange  for SIGI-HMM, etc.). An easy to view list of islands can be produced in Artemis by using the &quot;Feature Selector&quot; under the &quot;Select&quot; menu and filling in:</p>

		  <ul class="bodyText">
		    <li>Key = &quot;misc_feature&quot;</li>
	        <li> Qualifier = &quot;note&quot;</li>
		    <li>Containing this text = &quot;Genomic Island&quot;</li>
		    </ul>		  

<p class="bodyText">Along with the inspection of genes neighbouring and within GIs, sequence composition graphs, such as GC content and Karlin Signature Difference, can be added via the Graph menu. Users with their own GI predictions or other genome features, such as IS or direct repeat elements, can add their data to Artemis after constructing a fairly <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Artemis/manual/concepts.html#CONCEPTS-TABFILE">simple input file</a>. </p>

<p class="bodyText"><a href="http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandpath/">IslandPath</a>, displays many features that are often associated with genomic islands, such as various types of sequence composition bias, tRNAs, and integrases and transposases. These features are shown together in a single integrated view and may help in determining the location of GIs. IslandViewer contains a direct link to IslandPath for the genome being viewed on the left column of every results page. </p>

<p class="bodyText"><a href="http://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/">Mauve</a>, is a whole genome alignment tool that can be used to view genome rearrangements and large insertions in related genomes. By using the IslandViewer GenBank download file along with your choice of other closely related bacteria genomes, GIs can be viewed in the context of other genomes and conserved regions surrounding these regions can be inspected further.
